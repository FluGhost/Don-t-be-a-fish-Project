# Don't be a fish - Project
This project is created and invented by FluGhost. I'd lite to make a phishing website but a good phishing website : I'm sure you have a friend or grand parents who doesn't be strong in computer science, maybe he calls you everytime when he wants to send an e-mail...
This person says : `"Internet is sure in 2020"`, but you know it's false and you would like to show him that's the opposite.
So this project is made for **you** !
You go on the website project, you enter your name and your friend's e-mail. In one minute, a **fake** phishing e-mail will be send in you friend's box.
So your friend click and he arrives in this website who says `"Hey, you have been hacked by [your name] ! Be prudent when you click on a link ! This is a good lesson to you, remember it !"` and now, you are the superhero of the world, good job !

If you like this you can **Star this project**... Thanks !
