# Don't be a fish - Project

This project is created and invented by FluGhost.

## <span style="color : red;">WARNING !</span>
> This is a sensitization project, This will **NOT** hack you or anyone or anything !

I'm sure you have a friend or grand parents who doesn't be strong in computer science, maybe he calls you everytime when he wants to send an e-mail...
This person says : `"Internet is sure in 2020"`, but you *(and me)* know it's false and you *(and me again)* would like to show him that's the opposite.

So this project is made for **you** !
You go on the website project, you enter your name and your friend's e-mail. In one minute, a **fake** phishing e-mail will be send in you friend's box.
So your friend click and he arrives in this website who says a sensitization message `"Hey, you have been sensitizated by [your name] because you click on a fake e-mail ! If that wasn't a fake phishing e-mail, this website request your id or your password or, your CREDIT CARD ! Be prudent when you click on a link ! This is a good lesson for you, remember it !"` and now, you are the superhero of the world, good job !

If you like this you can **Star this project**... Thanks !
